# Ripple

A community oriented web applicated indented to promote acts of service and goodwill. Ripple provides daily inspiration for good deeds and hosts a community message board where users can advertise service opportunities. The code for the web-app itself is located in `startup/`

### Elevator pitch

Do you want to help the world become a better place, but just feel overwhelmed by how much needs to be accomplished? The Ripple application provides daily inspiration for simples acts of service that can be seemlessly integrated into your normal routine. When you complete an act of service, you can mark it done to update a running count of good deeds and record your experience in a digital journal. Additionally, if you are aware of service opportunities in your community, you can post on a community message board to raise awareness of that need. The message board is upadated in realtime to provide users with easy access to the most recent and relavent information.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Using correct HTML structure, this application will have four HTML pages. The homepage (where daily service inpsiration is displayed), a second for login, a third for the digitial journal, and a fourth for the community message board.
- **CSS** - Application styling that allows easy veiwing on all screen sizes, maintaining good whitespace, readablity, and functional element access.
- **React** - Provides functionality for login, marking good deeds completed, displaying good deeds total, and backend endpoint calls.
- **Service** - Backend sercice with endpoints for:
    - Register, login, and logout users. Credentials securely stored in database. Users cannot create journal entries or posts unless authenticated.
    - Creating digital journal entries.
    - Retriving digital journal contents.
    - Creating message boarrd posts.
    - Retriving message board posts.
- **DB/Login** - Store login infromation, users, journal entries, and community posts in database.
- **WebSocket** - Whenever a user marks the daily service inspiration complete, the total and daily good deeds counters will be updated and boarcast to all users. Whenever a user posts about a service opportunity to the message board, that new post will be boardcast to all users.
